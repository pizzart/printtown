jake: your stickerbook is arguably the most important tool at your disposal.
jake: it contains every single animal you've caught, all of which have 3 actions.
jake: the first one is healing. the more cute an animal is - the more it heals you.
jake: second is biting. it reduces the enemy's guard, mood and health. useful against either strong or stubborn guys.
jake: third\: convincing. it can either succeed or fail. in both cases, the mood goes up, and guard goes down. useful against stubborn enemies.
