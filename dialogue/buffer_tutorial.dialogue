jake: hi, sorry to interrupt you at such a time, but you [wave amp=25 freq=5]do[/wave] know that you can buffer jumps while in the air, right?
{{player_name}}: umm.. no? what do you mean?
jake: you just hold space while in the air to buffer the next jump, and it gives you a nice speed boost when you land!
jake: though, if you jump, and then don't release the button, nothing will happen.
{{player_name}}: i do not understand anything. why do you keep mentioning keyboards and mice and the like???
jake: do not worry about it, i'll explain later. don't fall!
